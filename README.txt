	This problem was given as a former Kaggle competition in which the participants had
	to predict sale prices of bulldozers to be sold in future given all the past data. 
	Although this competition has ended yet I have worked on this problem to enhance 
	my Machine Learning skills.
	
	The goal of the contest was to predict the future sale price of a bulldozer 
	given it's characteristics and previous examples of  of how much were similar 
	bulldozers sold for.
